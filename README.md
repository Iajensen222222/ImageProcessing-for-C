# ImageProcessing-for-C

## Description
This project will take a jpg image and apply a filter onto it. There are three to choose from: blur, sharpen, and black-and-white. Sharpen comes with a strength modifier which sharepns the image more or less depending on what is needed. This project is very similiar to the one I made using Python.

## Usage
All you have to do is add the type of filter you want (blur, sharpen, or bw), the image's file path (easiest to have it in the same folder) you want to transform, and the name of the output image.
If you are using the sharpen function, make sure to add a strength modifier (default is 1.0).

## Installations
For this application, make sure to have stdlib.c, stdio.c, time.c, and string.c installed.
<p>If not, there are plenty of online sources to download those c files.</p>

After you have installed all the necessary c files, you can finally use the application.

## Work in Progress
- Currently working on a way to blur and sharpen non black-and-white images
- Attempting to allow any gausian kernel to be implemeneted which would allow more complex image manipulation.
